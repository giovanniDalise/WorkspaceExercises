Name:FileInputStream

Package:java.io

Descrizione:Un FileInputStream ottiene i byte di input da un file in un file system. I file disponibili dipendono dall'ambiente host.
FileInputStream Ã¨ pensato per leggere flussi di byte grezzi come i dati immagine. Per leggere flussi di caratteri, prendi in considerazione l'utilizzo di FileReader.

Costruttori:
FileInputStream(File file)
Creates a FileInputStream by opening a connection to an actual file, the file named by the File object file in the file system.

FileInputStream(FileDescriptor fdObj)
Creates a FileInputStream by using the file descriptor fdObj, which represents an existing connection to an actual file in the file system.

FileInputStream(String name)
Creates a FileInputStream by opening a connection to an actual file, the file named by the path name name in the file system.

METODI:
available()
Returns an estimate of the number of remaining bytes that can be read (or skipped over) from this input stream without blocking by the next invocation of a method for this input stream.

close()
Closes this file input stream and releases any system resources associated with the stream.

finalize()
Ensures that the close method of this file input stream is called when there are no more references to it.

read()
Reads a byte of data from this input stream.

skip(long n)
Skips over and discards n bytes of data from the input stream.
