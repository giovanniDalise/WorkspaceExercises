Class: Statement
package:java.sql

Descrizione:
The object used for executing a static SQL statement and returning the results it produces.
By default, only one ResultSet object per Statement object can be open at the same time. 
Therefore, if the reading of one ResultSet object is interleaved with the reading of another, 
each must have been generated by different Statement objects. All execution methods in the Statement interface implicitly close a current ResultSet object of the statement if an open one exists.

Campi:
CLOSE_ALL_RESULTS
The constant indicating that all ResultSet objects that have previously been kept open should be closed when calling getMoreResults.

CLOSE_CURRENT_RESULT
The constant indicating that the current ResultSet object should be closed when calling getMoreResults.

EXECUTE_FAILED
The constant indicating that an error occurred while executing a batch statement.
